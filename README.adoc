Inspired by https://requestcatcher.com, but deploy your own version.

Ideally you should have an HTTP server sitting in front of this app. In my case I used Nginx. A reverse proxy is set up to redirect traffic ft to the application.

"/ws" is where the client connects to the app using a websocket connection. "/" is for requesting the base HTML page(index.html)
```
location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://100.115.24.87:8888/ws;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
location / {
   proxy_pass http://100.115.24.87:8888/;
}
```
